DevOps Phases
	- Continuous Development
	- Continuous Testing
	- Continuous Intgration
	- Continuous Deployment
	- Continuous Monitoring

Git
Git Installation
Git Lifecycle
	- Working Directory
	- Initialization
	- Staging(can include or exclued from commit)
	- Local Storage (Commit)
	- Push to GitHub(Cloud Server)

Git Common Command
	Git Init
		This is used for initializing your local folder(working directory) as local Git Repository.
	Git status
		This is used for checking the status of your local Git Repository. Like, what are the updated or newly added file to your local git repository.
	Git add <filename>
		This is used for adding all the updated or newly added file to the staging area so that you can commit those files to your local Git Repository.
	Git commit -m "<comment>“
		This is used for saving or commit the staged changes to your local Git Repository.
	git remote add origin <remote repo path>
		This is used for mapping your remote git repository with your local Git Repository. So that when you push the committed changes, those will get pushed to your remote repository
	git push –u origin main
		This is used to push you committed changes to you remote repository.
	

Advanced commands
	git clone
		cloning/getting your existing remote repository to you local
	git pull
		get/download the latest chages from the remote branch
	git fetch
		fetch down all the branches from remote repository
	git branch
		list all the branches from your local repository. A '*' will appear next to the current active branch
	git branch <branch name>
		Creates new branch
	git checkout <branch name>
		switch to the given branch
	
	git reset <file name>
		unstage but keeps the changes in the working derectory for the given file
	git restore --stage <filename>
		unstage and undo changes from the working directory
	git reset head~1
		undoing your last one commit
	git cherry-pick <commit-hash>

	

Master/Main branch 
	Develop - Integration branch which is used to interate the different branches from different developers.
		feature branches - by different developer

Pull request - pull is used o merge your feature branch into the parent branch.

Create Agent in Jenkins
After configuring Agent in jenkins make the connection to that agent to start it
javaws http://localhost:8080/computer/Agent1/jenkins-agent.jnlp

-----------------------------
Containerization:
	lets say we have created or built an application with different libraries and dependencies
	Dev Env: Python 5.4.3 and pycharm IDE
	QA Env : Python 5.3.0 and spider IDE

	when the application or the code gets deployed to QA environment. it failed to run because there is a difference in python version and IDE.

	To resolve this issue we make use of containerization.

	What is Container: Container is a softwre that wrap up all the component of a code and all its dependencies
	into a single deployeble unit that can be used on different servers and systems.

Docker:
	Docker is a containerization tool that helps in developing, building, deploying and executing
softwere in isolation. It does by creating containers that completly wrap a softwere.
